This is an initial javascript project. I will attempt to create a console-based Roshambo game.

This is meant to convey and give me practice with functions, conditionals, if statements, and
	if I can find and understand outside resources looping.

I'll attempt to do this project with minimal outside help. Particularly other student projects.
